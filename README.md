Odin Project Calculator

Commit 1 had several bugs. And, while I was able to get some of the code to work, I did not feel confident that I could optimize and explain my code if asked.

I started from scratch with Commit 2. For this version, I can explain the decision behind each line of code. Because I revisited arrays,  objects, and higher order functions, I was able to complete this Calculator Project with significantly more ease.

I also added UI using css grid.
